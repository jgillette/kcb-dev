					<h3>Donna Deaven, Conductor</h3>
					<img alt="" src="images/donnaDeaven.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"> 
					Donna J. Deaven has more than 12 years of experience in conducting bands, 
					orchestras, and small ensembles, and 15 years of experience as a private 
					teacher and professional musician.<br><br>
					Ms. Deaven graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Music Education 
					and a Master of Music degree in saxophone performance from West Chester University, 
					where she studied with Ted Hegvik.<br><br>
					Ms. Deaven is also the Assistant Conductor of the New Cumberland Town Band, 
					a founding member and baritone saxophone player in the Keystone Saxophone Quartet, 
					a member of the Flutes of Fancy Flute Ensemble, and a performing member of the Wednesday 
					Club. She is also Music Director/Conductor of the Harrisburg Chamber 
					Ensemble. In addition, Ms. Deaven leads a combo called "Donna and the 
					Daytimers."<br><br>
					Ms.Deaven's previous affiliations include the New 
					Singer Band of Mechanicsburg, the West Shore Symphony Orchestra, the 
					Hershey Symphony Orchestra, Harrisburg Area Community College, the Harrisburg 
					Community Theater, and York Little Theater.<br><br>
					In addition to conducting, Ms. Deaven's education and experience include studying and 
					performing on the saxophone, flute, clarinet and percussion. She also maintains 
					a private woodwind teaching studio in Camp Hill. <br><br>
					<h3>John Hope, Assistant Conductor</h3>
					<img alt="" src="images/johnHope.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"> 
					John Hope has always regretted not learning to play the piano when his 
					mother was teaching other children in their Philadelphia home. He did, 
					however, take drum lessons in elementary school and played in the elementary 
					and junior high school orchestras.<br><br>Later, he played in the Ursinus College
					band for two years. More of his time was spent, however, as a member of the Meistersingers,
					the college touring concert choir, for which John was the student conductor in his last
					three years in school.<br><br>
					He joined the Keystone Concert Band percussion section more than 15 years ago. 
					A few years later, conductor Donna Deaven asked him to lead a march at rehearsal while 
					she dealt with another issue. He is now the band's assistant conductor, 
					leading one or two numbers at each concert and taking over for Donna 
					when she is unable to be at a rehearsal or concert.

                    The Keystone Concert Band Board of Directors met on June 2nd at 7:30pm EDT and unanimously agreed to
                    resume in-person rehearsals starting on July 14th at 7:30pm EDT. Please read below
                    for important information about our return to in-person rehearsals.<br />
                    <br />
                    We are at a point where the risk of transmission is very low and a return to rehearsals at this time
                    is in compliance with federal, state, and local guidelines.
                    The high vaccination rate of our ensemble will help ensure that everyone is protected.
                    If you are not vaccinated, you are still welcome to join us for rehearsals, but understand that you
                    are participating at your own risk; unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to COVID should
                    continue to quarantine and follow public health guidelines.
                    Regardless of your vaccination status, if you are feeling ill, please be respectful of your fellow
                    band members and do not show up to rehearsal.<br />
                    <br>
                    <h3>Results of the "Returning to In-Person Rehearsals Questionnaire:"</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At the time of the questionnaire's completion, nearly 73% of respondents were enthusiastic
                            about
                            returning to in-person rehearsals.</li>
                        <li>12% of respondents indicated some level of concern about safety.</li>
                        <li>There was almost a three-way tie between June, July, and August for returning to in-person
                            rehearsals. This was the deciding factor for determining the date of return.</li>
                        <li>Nearly 95% of respondents said they are fully vaccinated.</li>
                    </ul><br />
                    <h3>Safety Measures in Place:</h3>
                    The Board will still continue to monitor cases in the state, specifically Cumberland, Dauphin, York,
                    and Lancaster counties. If another surge were to happen, specifically in Dauphin County, we are
                    prepared to pause in-person rehearsals until cases go back down.<br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>We will have hand sanitizer and both stairwells available for all band members to use.</li>
                        <li>A wheelchair lift is currently being or has been installed. It may still be under
                            construction when
                            we come back on July 14th. If this is the case, please use the other stairwell on the other
                            side of the church. We will help direct you to those stairs. More updates about the
                            wheelchair lift's construction will be provided as the July 14th rehearsal approaches</li>
                        <li>Puppy pads for brass players will be provided to control cleanliness of the rehearsal space.
                        </li>
                        <li>We will be spreading out the chairs more throughout the room.</li>
                        <li>The PA mask mandate was dropped as of June 28th. Masks will not be required but are optional
                            if you want to use them.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <h3>Changes/Clarification for Rehearsal Procedure:</h3>
                    For the first rehearsal, we will only practice for about 1 hour, so we can get
                    reacclimated to playing our instruments again in the same room.
                    Decisions for the length of time for future rehearsals will be determined on July 14 with input from
                    the band.<br />
                    <br />
                    <h3>Concerts Currently Booked:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Church of the Good Shepherd Yard Sale (outdoors) - 9/11/2021 at 10:00am</li>
                        <li>Lingelstown Life - 10/9/2021 at 7:00pm</li>
                        <li>St. Andrews Christmas Concert - 12/4/2021 at 11:00am</li>
                        <li>All Saints Christmas Concert - TBD</li>
                    </ul><br />
                    <h3>Returning Folders:</h3>
                    If you signed out a folder from the bins, it must be returned to the bins at rehearsal on July 14th.
                    If you are not planning to participate on July 14th, we still need your folder turned in. The
                    folders need to be available for other musicians to use at rehearsal. Please be sure all music is
                    sorted in alphabetical order.
                    <br />
                    Our assistant conductor, Christopher Mack, will have a sign-out sheet with the list of folders that
                    were taken out of the bins. Please bring your folder to him so he can mark you off as turning it in.
                    If you would like to take a folder home to practice, you can then use the regular sign-out sheet
                    that is kept with the bins.<br />
                    <br />
                    <h3>New Members</h3>
                    As we start back up, we will be in need of new players in all instruments to join. If interested,
                    please fill out our form on <a href="https://www.keystoneconcertband.com/join.php">the Join Us page</a>, and we'll be sure to get back in contact with you!
                    <br /><br/>
                    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                    It is obvious that these last 16 months of not playing music together in-person have been brutal. On
                    behalf of our lead conductor and the Board of Directors, we wish everyone good health and good
                    spirits. We hope to see you on July 14th at the church!
